We conducted an extensive GPS based data extraction, transformation and load (ETL) process, consolidating household sample data from DHS Survey datasets with geospatial open sources like GADM and OpenStreetMap. Using econometric models we assessed the impact of key factors such as householdâ€™s wealth and distance to the nearest health facility on VAS Coverage outcomes. Afterwards, we modeled different scenarios to evaluate the changes in coverage outcomes while changing service delivery modality, average distance and supplies availability. At the same time, we estimate the average costs of each service modality for each child covered.
