We conducted an extensive GPS based data extraction, transformation and load (ETL) process, consolidating household sample data from The DHS Program Survey, GPS and SPA datasets with geospatial open sources like GADM and OpenStreetMap. Using econometric models we assessed the impact of key factors, such as householdâ€™s wealth and distance to the nearest health facility, on VAS Coverage outcomes at the level of household's cluster and children cluster. Afterwards, we modeled different scenarios to evaluate the changes in coverage outcomes while changing service delivery modality, average distance and supplies availability, while estimating the associated average costs of each intervention per each child covered. Several GIS (Geographic Information Systems) visualizations were provided, along with a full report and summary tables for our clients.
